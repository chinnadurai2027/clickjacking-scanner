Clickjacking Vulnerability Scanner 👾

🚀 Introduction

Welcome to Clickjacking Vulnerability Scanner!  
This project is a Python-based tool that checks whether a website is vulnerable to the notorious Clickjacking attack. Using this tool, you can protect your website from an invisible iframe-based attack that misleads users into clicking something different than what they perceive. 🛡️

Clickjacking attacks are real threats to online security, and this script will help you stay safe.

📌 Key Features

- Simple and Easy to Use💻
- Checks websites for X-Frame-Options vulnerability.
- Optional: View HTTP Response Headers for detailed information 🕵️‍♂️
- Can be integrated with GUI for ease of use 🖥️

 🔧 Technologies Used
     Python 3 🐍
     Requests Library for sending HTTP requests 📤
     argparse for command-line arguments 🎛️

🎯Protecting Against Clickjacking

Clickjacking works by tricking the user into clicking an invisible frame placed over a legitimate webpage, leading to unintentional actions. Webmasters can prevent these attacks by setting appropriate **X-Frame-Options** or using **Content Security Policy** headers:

- `DENY`: Blocks the page from being framed.
- `SAMEORIGIN`: Allows the page to be framed only by pages from the same origin.
- `ALLOW-FROM <uri>`: Allows framing only from a specific source (deprecated).

Make sure to secure your site with these headers!

🏗️ Installation

To get started, you need to have Python 3.x installed. If you don't have Python, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 🌍

1. Clone this repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clickjacking-vulnerability-scanner.git
    cd clickjacking-vulnerability-scanner
    

2. Install the dependencies:

    bash
    pip install requests
    

3. You are good to go! 🚀

📦Usage

To check if a website is vulnerable to clickjacking, simply use the following command:

bash
python clickjacking_scanner.py <URL>
If you want to see the HTTP headers for a deeper analysis:

bash
python clickjacking_scanner.py <URL> -l

Example:
bash
python clickjacking_scanner.py https://example.com

Output:

[+] https://example.com may be vulnerable to clickjacking.

Response Headers:
X-Frame-Options: DENY
💻 UI Version (Future Work)
This project can also be extended with a GUI (Graphical User Interface), making it even easier for users to check their websites' security by clicking buttons and providing URLs instead of using the command line.
